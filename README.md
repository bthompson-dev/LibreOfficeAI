# LibreOfficeAI

The AI Assistant for LibreOffice app integrates local AI with LibreOffice Writer and Impress. It allows you to create and edit documents and presentations using a chat interface. You can simply send it a message and it will carry out your request.

e.g. “Please create me a sales pitch presentation for the new Intel laptops”

The app also offers voice transcription using Whisper, allowing users to interact with the AI without typing. All AI models are run locally on-device, so it does not need an internet connection and keeps all data completely secure. It integrates an MCP Server which gives the AI direct access to LibreOffice functionality.

## 📄 AI Response

Once your message is processed, the AI will respond. If tools are used, they will be listed at the top of the response.

If a document or presentation is created or edited, the filename will appear as a clickable link beneath the LibreOffice logo. Double-clicking the link opens the file in LibreOffice or your default editor.

## 🆕 Starting a New Chat

For new tasks, it's recommended to start a fresh chat using the button at the top left of the screen.

> The AI has limited memory. Long conversations may cause it to forget earlier context. Starting a new chat resets the conversation history.

Let me know if you'd like this split into separate sections for multi-page rendering, or if you want collapsible details for GitHub's `<details>` tags. I can also help you generate badges or link this to your build guide.
